TBD
- Implemented #18 - support for multiple NTLM proxies that will be iterated
  through if connection fails
- Included fix for allowing parent proxy to resolve hostname if not resolvable
  locally - #18
- Added --socktimeout to configure maximum time to wait before giving up on
  socket connections

- Make --proxy an optional setting if --noproxy is defined, reject connections
  if remote server isn't in noproxy list and no proxy defined
- Add --hostonly which only allows IP addresses assigned to local interfaces to
  use Px. Disallow any external clients unless --gateway specified along with a
  restrictive --allow definition - PR20

- Ensure logs are generated where Px is instead of working directory and flushed
  immediately, quit should log in separate file and not overwrite MainProcess
- Added --uniqlog to allow multiple instances of Px to run with separate log
  destinations or to prevent overwriting logs on subsequent runs
- Sanitize auth exchanges in generated logs for easy sharing in issues
