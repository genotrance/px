; Force instead of discovering upstream proxy type
;   By default, Px will attempt to discover the upstream proxy type. This
;   option can be used to force either NEGOTIATE, NTLM, DIGEST, BASIC or the
;   other libcurl supported upstream proxy types. See:
;     https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH.html
;   To control which methods are available during proxy detection:
;     Prefix NO to avoid method - e.g. NONTLM => ANY - NTLM
;     Prefix SAFENO to avoid method - e.g. SAFENONTLM => ANYSAFE - NTLM
;     Prefix ONLY to support only that method - e.g ONLYNTLM => ONLY + NTLM
;   Set to NONE to defer all authentication to the client. This allows multiple
;   instances of Px to be chained together to access an upstream proxy that is not
;   directly connected:
;     Client -> Auth Px -> no-Auth Px -> Upstream proxy
;       'Auth Px' cannot directly access upstream proxy but 'no-Auth Px' can
