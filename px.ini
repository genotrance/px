gateway = 0

; Allow only local interfaces to use proxy. 0 or 1, default: 0
;   Px allows all IP addresses assigned to local interfaces to use the service.
;   This allows local apps as well as VM or container apps to use Px when in a
;   NAT config. Px does this by listening on all interfaces and overriding the
;   allow list.

; Authentication to use when SSPI is unavailable. Format is domain\\username
; Service name "Px" and this username are used to retrieve the password using
; Python keyring. Px only retrieves credentials and storage should be done
; directly in the keyring backend.
;   On Windows, Credential Manager is the recommended backed and can be accessed
;   from Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager > Windows Credentials.
;   Create a generic credential with Px as the network address, this username
;   and corresponding password.
;   On Linux, Gnome Keyring or KWallet can be used to store passwords. For headless
;   systems, the keyring_jeepney package might be needed.

; Force instead of discovering upstream proxy type
;   By default, Px will attempt to discover the upstream proxy type. This
;   option can be used to force either NTLM, KERBEROS, DIGEST, BASIC or the
;   other libcurl supported upstream proxy types. See:
;     https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH.html
;   To control which methods are available during proxy detection:
;     Prefix NO to avoid method - e.g. NONTLM => ANY - NTLM
;     Prefix SAFENO to avoid method - e.g. SAFENONTLM => ANYSAFE - NTLM
;     Prefix ONLY to support only that method - e.g ONLYNTLM => ONLY + NTLM
